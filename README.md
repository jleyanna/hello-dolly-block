The historic [Hello Dolly](https://wordpress.org/plugins/hello-dolly/) plugin, but in block form.

Debuted at WordCamp US 2022, the Hello Dolly Block demonstrates how quickly a dynamic block can be created using modern techniques, core components, and block supports. This plugin was built using the [Create Block](https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/packages/packages-create-block/) package and should be considered experimental.
